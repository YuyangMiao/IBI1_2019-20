Question: How have new cases and total cases developed over time in Spain?

The question is addressed from line 72 to line 87 in the covid.py Ô¨Åle.

Discussion: The result met my expectations. On the early stage of COVID-19 
                   outbreak, people are neglectful of taking precautions. One infected 
                   person can pass the virus to other persons, and the process will 
                   keep going. Consequently, total cases grow rapidly at these days.
