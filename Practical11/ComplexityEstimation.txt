The worst case:
Suppose N numbers are inputted.
After permutation, there will be N! orders.
For each order, 5^(N-1) results will be generated (5^(N-1) elements in list1).
Every elements in list1 is a result after N-1 times operation
so the total recursion times is (N-1)*N!* 5^(N-1)
O((N-1)*N!* 5^(N-1))=N!
